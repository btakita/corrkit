# Writing Voice

Derived from analysis of 25+ sent messages across 2009-2023.

- Warm, professional, and earnest without being formal -- approachable and direct, no corporate jargon
- Short to medium sentences (10-20 words); paragraphs kept to 2-5 sentences
- Opens with "Hey," "Hi," or "Hello [name]" depending on familiarity; no "Dear"
- Closes with "Thanks, Brian" or "-- Brian"; never "Best," "Regards," or "Sincerely"
- Contractions used freely ("I'm," "don't," "it's") even in professional contexts
- Uses "&" instead of "and" in lists and explanations
- Uses bullet points or lists when presenting options, problems, or multiple items
- Gets to the point quickly -- no preamble in follow-ups or brief clarifications
- Direct and solution-oriented on technical topics; assumes competence from the reader
- When complex, explains the "why" behind proposals rather than just stating conclusions
- Honest and tactful when critical -- explains the reason behind a concern rather than just complaining
- Uses "I" statements to take ownership ("I'm working on," "I noticed," "I added")
- Minimal punctuation affectations -- dashes (--) for breaks, rarely exclamation marks
- No signatures with titles, taglines, or formal affectations -- just name, sometimes phone/URL
- No smiley faces or emoji in professional contexts
